# Sorterr
Media sorting scripted based on Guessit.  Personally this runs after Unpackkerr does a unpack.  I also have run it on large collections I already had.

Supported Media Type:
mp4, avi, mkv, m4v

Expected Output of Moving files.

[TVPath]/[ShowName]/[Season # or Specials]/[ShowName] [Season#/Epi#] [Epi Title] [Video info] [AudioChannels].extension
[MoviePath]/[Movie Title] [Year] [Alt Title or Other info] [Video Info] [Audio Channels].extension

There are few configution options.  Which you can see below

This should be where Sorterr finds the unsorted files.
downloadPath = "/srv/mergerfs/pool0/Downloads/"

This is where it should sort TV shows to
TVPath = "/srv/mergerfs/pool0/TV/"

This is where it should sort Movies to.
MoviesPath = "/srv/mergerfs/pool0/Movies/"

Use ffmpeg to check for Resolution and sample audio if Im already sampling Resolution.
Use_FFMPEG = 		1

Delete the sub directies when done.
DeletionEnabled = 	1

Moves the Renamed files into TV and Movie Path.  Doesnt work without renaming me on.
MoveEnabled = 		1

Controls whether to rename or not.
RenameEnabled = 	1

Debugging stuff.   Testmode should probably be run on anything with a weird folder setup first.
NOISEY =			0
TESTMODE =			0
